/**
 * @addtogroup webcom-base
 * @{
 * This SDK is fundamentally asynchronous, and is meant to be easily used in a
 * mono-threaded application. The logic to achieve this is quite complex, and
 * if you don't mind to depend on libev, there is no need to manually deal with
 * any of the operations and concepts described below, go directly to the @link
 * webcom-libev "connect with libev" @endlink section.
 *
 * If you don't plan to rely on libev, here are the steps and logic to implement :
 *
 * ## Populate a `wc_context_options` structure :
 *
 * The `wc_context_options::callback` field must contain a pointer to a function
 * you have defined (of type `wc_on_event_cb_t`) in your code, and that will
 * be triggered by the SDK when various events happen (see `wc_event_t`).
 *
 * ## Keep track of the requested file descriptors and timers
 *
 * Whenever the SDK needs a file descriptor to be monitored for certain events,
 * or a timer to be set, it will trigger the callback with the appropriate event
 * and informations. For example, if the datasync part of the SDK needs the file
 * descriptor 42 to be monitored for read and write availability, the callback
 * will be called with the **WC_EVENT_ADD_FD** event, and the **data** parameter
 * will point to a `wc_pollargs` structure containing the following informations:
 *
 * @code{c}
 * {
 * 	.fd = 42,
 * 	.events = WC_POLLIN | WC_POLLOUT,
 * 	.src = WC_POLL_DATASYNC,
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * To properly keep track of these events, an event-loop based on a `poll`-like
 * mechanism needs to be implemented. This can be achieved by manually using
 * `poll`, `epoll`, `kqueue`, ...
 *
 * ## Inform the SDK whenever an event (I/O, timer) occurs
 *
 * When a timer expires or a requested operation is available on a file
 * descriptor, the appropriate methods must be called right away:
 * - wc_dispatch_timer_event() if a timer expired
 * - wc_dispatch_fd_event() if an I/O event occurred
